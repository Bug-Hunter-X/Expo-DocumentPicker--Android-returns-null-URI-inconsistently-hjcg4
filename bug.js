This bug occurs when using the Expo DocumentPicker API on Android.  After selecting a file, the promise returned by DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync() sometimes resolves with a null URI, even when a file was successfully selected by the user. This makes it impossible to access the selected file.  The issue is particularly noticeable when selecting files from cloud storage providers. 

```javascript
import * as DocumentPicker from 'expo-document-picker';

async function pickDocument() {
  let result = await DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync({});
  console.log(result);
  if (result.uri) {
    // Process the selected file
  } else {
    console.error('URI is null!'); // This error occurs unexpectedly
  }
}
```
